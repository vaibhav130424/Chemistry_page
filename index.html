    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. 
        It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are
        classified into groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction</i>:
        <p><b>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O</b></p>
    </p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(H<sub>2</sub>)</i> and oxygen gas 
        <i>(O<sub>2</sub>)</i> to form water <i>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p><b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. 
        It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    </p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, 
        while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
    </p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our
    lives.
